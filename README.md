# HashPass

## Reinventing Event Tickets for a Smarter Future

At **HashPass**, we’re reinventing how event tickets work by transforming them into secure, smart digital passes powered by blockchain. These passes go far beyond entry—they enable loyalty programs, real-time access control, and post-event engagement, all in a single super-app.

## 🚀 Our Open Source Mission

HashPass is committed to building a better, fairer, and more innovative event experience for everyone. By making our platform open source, we empower communities, creators, and organizations to:

- **Trust the Process:** Blockchain-backed tickets ensure authenticity and transparency.
- **Own Their Experience:** Event organizers and attendees have full control over their digital passes and data.
- **Collaborate & Innovate:** Anyone can contribute, customize, and extend HashPass to fit unique needs.

We believe in a future where event access is frictionless, secure, and rewarding—for everyone.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Blockchain-Powered Security:** Eliminate fraud and scalping with verifiable, tamper-proof tickets.
- **Smart Digital Passes:** Tickets are more than just entry—they unlock loyalty rewards, discounts, and exclusive content.
- **Real-Time Access Control:** Manage entry, re-entry, and VIP privileges instantly and securely.
- **Post-Event Engagement:** Keep the conversation going with post-event content, offers, and community features.
- **Open API & Extensible:** Build your own integrations or contribute new features to the core platform.

## 🌍 Why Open Source?

We believe the future of events should be shaped by the community. By making HashPass open source, we:

- **Foster Transparency:** Anyone can inspect, audit, and improve the code.
- **Encourage Collaboration:** Developers, event organizers, and users can propose features, report issues, and submit improvements.
- **Support Innovation:** Open code means anyone can build new tools, integrations, and experiences on top of HashPass.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Monorepo layout

- **`apps/web-app`** — Main Expo Router web application (uses `@hashpass/*` packages).
- **`apps/directus`** — Directus SSO Docker setup for local auth testing.
- **`packages/`** — Shared packages: `@hashpass/auth`, `@hashpass/config`, `@hashpass/types`, `@hashpass/backend`, `@hashpass/utils`, `@hashpass/ui`.
- **`infrastructure/terraform`** — Terraform IaC (GCP, etc.).

Use **pnpm** and **Turborepo** at the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
pnpm run dev          # run web app from root (delegates to apps/web-app)
pnpm run dev:web-app  # run web app directly from apps/web-app
pnpm run dev:directus # run Directus Docker stack from apps/directus
pnpm run dev:all      # run web app + Directus (single Ctrl+C stops both)
=======
pnpm run dev          # run app from root (current default)
pnpm run dev:web-app  # run app from apps/web-app
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
pnpm run build:all    # turbo build all packages
```

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edcalderon/hashpass.tech.git
   cd hashpass.tech
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server:**
