-- Fix the uuid = text casting issue
-- The problem is that passes.user_id is UUID but we're comparing with TEXT

-- First, let's check what type the passes.user_id column actually is
-- Then fix the function accordingly

-- Option 1: If passes.user_id is UUID, we need to cast the TEXT parameter to UUID
-- Option 2: If passes.user_id is TEXT, we need to ensure proper casting

-- Let's create a function that handles both cases properly
